How to use
1. Get extractor (/giveme chemistry:extractor)
2. Place the extractor
3. Place node behind the arrow
4  Punch the extractor
5. Mine the atoms

6. Get reactor (/giveme chemistry:extractor)
7. Place the reactor
8. Build the reaction behind the arrow
9. Punch reactor to create block(molecules)

Features
Extract atoms from world with extractor /giveme chemistry:extractor
React atoms to create blocks /giveme chemistry:reactor

API
That enables mod to implement chemistry crafts
example of water_source:
chemistry:register_reaction({"default:water_source",
  {"chemistry:O", "chemistry:O"},
  {"chemistry:and"},
  {"chemistry:H", "chemistry:H"},
  {"chemistry:H", "chemistry:H"},
})

Todo
* More crafts for extractor and reactor
* Fussion reactor to create rare elements
* Check and warn if enough space for craft

Changelog

0.4
* Supports moreores mod (blocks)
* Supports diamonds mod (blocks)
* Made seperate crafts lua

0.3
* Extractor changes nodes into atoms

0.2
* Reactor function enables players to compose a molecule and react it to molecule(node)

0.1
* Elements nodes with textures
