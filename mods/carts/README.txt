===CARTS MOD for MINETEST-C55===
by PilzAdam

Version 27

Introduction:
This mod adds carts to minetest. There were rails for so long in minetest
but no carts so that they were useless. But this mod brings what many
players all over the world wanted for so long (I think so...).

How to install:
Unzip the archive an place it in minetest-base-directory/mods/minetest/
if you have a windows client or a linux run-in-place client. If you have
a linux system-wide instalation place it in ~/.minetest/mods/minetest/.
If you want to install this mod only in one world create the folder
worldmods/ in your worlddirectory.
For further information or help see:
http://wiki.minetest.com/wiki/Installing_Mods

How to use the mod:
Read the first post at http://minetest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2451

Configuration:
(If there is no file specified it is in init.lua)
line 1 in functions.lua: APPROXIMATION => see the topic in the forum
line 4: MAX_SPEED => the maximum speed of the cart
line 9: TRANSPORT_PLAYER => transport the player like a normal item 
		 (this is very laggy NOT RECOMMENDED)
line 13: SOUND_FILE => name of a soundfile that is played when the cart 
		 drives. To use your own sound put the soundfile (only .ogg) in
		 carts/sounds/ and set the variable to the name (e.g. "test.ogg").
line 17: SOUND_GAIN => the gain of the sound.
line 23: RAILS => blocks that should be treated as rails.
