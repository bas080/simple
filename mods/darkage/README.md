=== DarkAge MOD for MINETEST-C55 ===
by Master Gollum

Introduction:
  This mod adds a few new blocks that allows to create new buildings in a
  pre industrial landscape. Of course, feel free to use them in any other 
  construction :P

  I used mainly 4 square recipes to avoid collisions with other MODs, 
  anyway I have not checked all them, so it is possible that another 
  person is already using one or more of this combinations.

  I also used Desert Sand and Desert Stone, because they almost are not
  used in the default version. Probably I will change this recipes in 
  the next release.

PS: This document has been structured as the README.txt of PilzAdam in 
    his Bed MOD.

How to use the mod:
  Just craft or cook some blocks and you will get the new ones.

    Basalt: a darken version of the default Stone
       COOKING
       [Basalt Cobble]

    Basalt Cobble: A darken version of the default Cobble
       CRAFT -> 4
       [Cobble] [Cobble]
       [Coal Lumb] [Coal Lumb]

    Dark Dirt: A darken version of the Dirt where the grass doesn't
       grown, perfect for create a path in a forest. I was using
       Ggravel, but the noise walking was annoying to me (like
       walking over iron coal with the nude feet :P), for this I
       created this node.
       CRAFT -> 4
       [Dirt] [Dirt]
       [Gravel] [Gravel]

    Old Red Sandstone: A light red sandstone, in fact it's 
       sandstone with iron that gives it this color.
       CRAFT -> 4
       [Sandstone] [Sandstone]
       [Iron Lumb] [Sandstone]
       COOKING
       [Old Red Sandstone Cobble]

    Old Red Sandstone Cobble: Cobbles of Old Red Sandstone.
       CRAFT -> 4
       [Sandstone Cobble] [Sandstone Cobble]
       [Iron Lumb] [Sandstone Cobble]
       COOKING
       [Desert Stone] --> I think I will change it in the future
                          release with its own Cobbles.
    
   Sandstone Cobble: brick version of the Sandstone, good for
       buildings with a pale color.
       COOKING
       [Sandstone]

   Desert Stone: just the default block, it can be obtained now
       from Desert Sand. The idea is that Desert Sand is stonner
       than regular Sand, so it takes less to create a Desert
       Stone than a Sandstone.
       CRAFT -> 2
       [Sandstone] [Sandstone]
       [Sandstone] [Sandstone]
