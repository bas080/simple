-- Before using this code, consult the README, particularly the "Semi-
-- automatic generation of textures" section at the end, which descibes the
-- use of the gentextures.sh BASH script included in this package.  You"ll
-- need to either follow those instructions or create your textures the usual,
-- manual way.  Without textures, this code won"t be very useful. :-)

-- When configured properly, this code creates node names that follow the
-- naming convention established in Unified Dyes, such as "mymod:red" or
-- "mymod:dark_yellow_s50".


-- ===========================================================================
-- Edit the next several variables to define what mod this template will
-- generate and how it should behave in general.
-- ===========================================================================

-- First, the standard machine-readable name of your mod

colored_block_modname = "cotton"

-- Human-readable description of the category of nodes you want to generate

colored_block_description = "Cotton"

-- The full node name of the neutral version of your main block as it
-- exists right after crafting or mining it, before any dyes have been
-- applied.  Typically, this should refer to the white version of your
-- mod's main block, but it can be anything as long as it makes sense.

neutral_block = colored_block_modname..":white"

-- This variable defines just how many of a given block a crafting operation
-- should give.  In most cases, the default (1) is correct.

colored_block_yield = "1"

-- If this object should let sunlight pass through it, set this to "true".
-- Otherwise, set it to "false" (the default).

colored_block_sunlight = "false"

-- If the node should be something you can stand on, set this to "true"
-- (the default).  Otherwise, set it to false.

colored_block_walkable = "true"

-- What groups should the generated nodes belong to?  Note that this must
-- be in the form of a table as in the default.

colored_block_groups = { snappy=3, flammable=2 }

-- What sound should be played when the node is digged?

colored_block_sound = "default.node_sound_leaves_defaults()"
