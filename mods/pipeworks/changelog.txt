---------

2012-08-19: Pumps and valves now fully participate in the 
auto-rotate/auto-place algorithm.

2012-08-18: Total rewrite again.  All pipes are now nice and round-looking, and 
they auto-connect!  Also added temporary nodes for pump and valve (each with an 
on/off setting - punch to change).  No crafting recipes yet and the pipes still 
don't do anything useful yet.  Soon.

2012-08-06:  Moved this changelog off the forum post and into a separate file.

2012-08-05 (multiple updates): Rewrote pipeworks to use loops and tables to 
create the nodes. Requires far less code now. Added -X, +X, -Y, +Y, -Z, +Z 
capped stubs and a short centered horizontal segment. Changed node definitions 
so that the aforementioned "short centered" segment is given on dig/drop.  
Renamed it to just "pipeworks:pipe" (and pipe_loaded). Added empty/loaded 
indicator images to the capped ends, removed some redundant comments. Made the 
empty/loaded indication at the capped end more prominent.

2012-07-21: Added screenshot showing pipes as they look now that nodebox 
texture rotation is fixed.

2012-07-18: Changed the mod name and all internals to 'pipeworks' instead of 
'pipes'... after a couple of mistakes :-)

2012-07-12: moved project to github.

2012-06-23: Initial release, followed by reworking the textures a bit.
