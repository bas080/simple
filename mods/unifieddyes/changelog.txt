Changelog:

2012-07-16 (a bit later): fixed a minor error in generation of medium grey.

2012-07-16: Added a new set of colors, "light" (brightness of 150% versus the 
'full' shade), for a total of 89.  No 50% saturation version of this set.  
Added a palette image showing the full set of colors.

2012-07-13:  Fixed some missing commas.

2012-07-13: Added a script to aid in the generation of new textures for mods 
that depend on unifieddyes.  Moved this changelog from the forum into the 
distribution directory.  Rewrote the README to contain everything from the 
forum post, and expanded it to document the new generation script.

2012-07-12 (a bit later): added groups = {dye=1}, to each register_craftitem 
call, to make it easier for other mods to identify the dyes and categorize 
them.

2012-07-12: moved project to github.

2012-07-11 (continuing): Tweaked the script to remove titanium dioxide from the 
output, since it isn't intended to be directly used as a dye/paint (but rather, 
to make paint that can then be used).  Regenerated colors.txt.

2012-07-11 (immediately after): The script was reading the wrong pixel from the 
image, resulting in lighter-than-correct colors.  Fixed it and regenerated the 
colors.txt file.

2012-07-11: Added a script to list all of the colors and their RGB values and 
texture filenames, and a text file containing the output thereof.

2012-07-08 (a bit later): deleted a few unused files (copy&paste error).

2012-07-08: Major boost in the number of available colors - was 8, now 77.  
Should cover pretty much the entire spectrum of colors one might use in this 
game.

2012-07-02: Deleted a few redundant files (leftovers from when I wanted to 
merge in flowers and then changed my mind).

2012-06-26: Initial upload.
