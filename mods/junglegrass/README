Since recent versions of Minetest no longer contain jungle biomes, and 
hence no jungle grass, I created this mod to re-add said grass back into 
the game, with a twist: There are now four different sizes of grasses, 
all of which yield a single junglegrass object when gathered (so all 
four sizes may be used where jungle grass is called for).  The largest 
size uses the game's standard jungle grass node, while the others are 
defined by this mod.

Junglegrass will spawn on dirt, grass, sand, desert sand and the tops of 
papyrus and cactus (though rarely), and will do so anywhere in the map.  
Grass on the ground will grow and eventually die (or turn into dry 
shrubs, in the desert), given enough time.

Adjusting the overall spawn/growth rate is easily done by tweaking the 
MAX_RATIO variable at the top of init.lua.  A larger value results in 
less frequent events.

Dependencies: none (just the game's default stuff)
